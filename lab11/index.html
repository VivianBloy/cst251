		<h3>Fun facts</h3>
		<p>I think possums are the best thing to ever exist ever. I love drawing them and generally obsessing about them. On that note I'm also
		   just a digital artist who is super into character design. I can put my legs behind my head and know a number of origami models off by heart,
			 which includes a skeletal hand and a paper crane pegasus. Back to the topic of drawing, I really enjoy working in ms paint alongside more
			 professional drawing programs.</p>

			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>This lab focuses on us dipping our toes into more complex block styling, including dropdowns, side content, and things more complex than
			   a page that is just full of paragraphs and links. The previously explored "image float right" is being expanded upon to make a website of
			   greater complexity overall and that will, with some effort, allow us to create something more modern and user friendly than just a lot of
			   text in a row.</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>Right off the bat, this entire topic seems intimidating, what with the addition of tags like Main and specific spacing and areas for different
			   content. Also just how a lot of these newer concepts work with manupulating block elements seem really complicated and confusing, although they
			   probably are a whole lot easier to use than they are to explain if past lessons were anything to consider. Alongside general typoes, it also
			   just felt difficult to get everything to work correctly, and to line up correctly on top of that with the work that we have done in previous classes
