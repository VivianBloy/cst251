		<h3>Fun facts</h3>
		<p>I think possums are the best thing to ever exist ever. I love drawing them and generally obsessing about them. On that note I'm also
		   just a digital artist who is super into character design. I can put my legs behind my head and know a number of origami models off by heart,
			 which includes a skeletal hand and a paper crane pegasus. Back to the topic of drawing, I really enjoy working in ms paint alongside more
			 professional drawing programs.</p>

			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>This lab focuses on us dipping our toes into more complex block styling, including dropdowns, side content, and things more complex than
			   a page that is just full of paragraphs and links. The previously explored "image float right" is being expanded upon to make a website of
			   greater complexity overall and that will, with some effort, allow us to create something more modern and user friendly than just a lot of
			   text in a row.</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>Right off the bat, this entire topic seems intimidating, what with the addition of tags like Main and specific spacing and areas for different
			   content. Also just how a lot of these newer concepts work with manupulating block elements seem really complicated and confusing, although they
			   probably are a whole lot easier to use than they are to explain if past lessons were anything to consider. Mostly I feel like I'm just confused
				 as to why and how specific things like float work, and where tags like fixed, absolute, and reletive apply. Mostly that will come in practice I
				 believe. In spite of everything and my confusion, I still got things to work in the end, even if I don't exactly understand everything of what
				 I did.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>While its nothing flashy, I was able to make button links at the top that stick to the top of the page while you scroll, alongside the sidebar of
			   information. I feel like there is almost definitely a cleaner way to make and impliment what I have here, and I am not at all positive if
			   I managed to correctly format the sidebar of information, looking at it after all this. That aside, I'm happy it wasnt entirely intimidating in practice
			   and overall.</p>
