		<h3>Challenges</h3>
		<p>The focus of this specific lab is to get more used to considering and working so that our websites are readable and correctly formatted across all forms
       of media devices, from the mundain such as phones or desktop computers, to the slightly more rare such as smart fridges or specially designed phones and computers
       for people hard of hearing or blind.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>honestly no major issues arose while chipping through this lab. No major gramatical errors showed up and the biggest hurdle was honestly just making
       sure my media tag was formatted correctly in order to actually make sure the thing was working across multiple devices. I also had to mess around a bit with
       the html file's formatting so as to better and easier use flexbox.</p>

		<h3>End Result</h3>
		<p>Compared to the previous lab, this one was a lot simpler but still very much an informative experience. Honestly I'm more glad than anyhting that shifting the
       code of an html file so that it works better on multiple devices is as easy as this seems. Admitedly I'm also positive that I've only just scratched the surface of
       small tweaks and edits that can be made to make a file more usable and understandable throughout multiple devices, including much less common ones</p>
