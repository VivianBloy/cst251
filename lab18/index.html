		<h3>Challenges</h3>
		<p>The challenge found within this lab mainly focuses on fine tuned layout editing and getting more used to what the properties of "float" and
       "flexbox" to better arange and shift around elements on a webpage. Not only is this good practice getting our heads around each of these ideas,
       it also lets us test out which works best with our own personal design style and how we might combine or work with them in the future as we're creating
       more professional sites.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>Honestly, this lab was just generally frustrating but still doable. While the float portion of this practice absolutely kept tripping me up as I just tried
       over and over to get my sidebar aligned the way i want it, I also managed to have a much easier time getting things into kind of the right places with Flexbox
       I feel like, through brute force more or less, I learned a fair bit about working with flexbox and its honestly made me exicted to continue to toy and mess with it
       to my desiered effect in future projects.</p>
