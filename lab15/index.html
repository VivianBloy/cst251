	<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>This lab really focuses in on the decoration and stylization required to edit and make more indepth, complex, and "fancy" looking webpages.
			 This includes using more complicated color pallets, gradients, "shadows" and different shapes of elements to create less basic and overall
		   more customizable webpages to better fit your own goals or your clients goals.</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>Honestly not all that many issues actually arose, as my team has been poking and prodding at these concepts for a while now as we've worked
		   on these labs. The main thing here arises with transform as, much like trying to center a css element, getting something exactly where you want
		   it on a page and in the exact right shape can be hard as heck.	Even so, after a bit of play it really didn't pose much of a challenge, even if
		   it didn't really play all that well with other modefiers.</p>
	<h2>End Result</h2>
		<p>Each and every single topic covered for this lesson felt intuitive and easy to manipulate, especially those in relation to editing how images appear
		   on the page. I feel like there's a whole lot you can do with these and Hover. Also, the only major issue that ended up arrising came from trying
		   to transform, specifically rotate, an image with "object-fit" already applied to it, which just seemed to cancel each rule out. That all said, I feel
		   like my page looks nice, if a bit hectic, and it was great practice for how to use these elements to edit elements.</p>
