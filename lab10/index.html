		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>This lab is focused on editing and styling this very text in an html file, in paragraphs, headers, and other on page text depictions
			   in order to shift them from being just the default into different arrangments, fonts, layouts, and colors. I believe that these conccepts
			   will also cross over into topics like block elements but for now we are just applying them to text.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The more and more we use classes, ids and other kinds of css tags and related items, a reacurring problem that I personally have been having
			   is misplaced tags, especially div tags, either forgetting to close them or having them around the wrong section by accident. Also keeping the
			   . and # in CSS rules has been somewhat difficult, albeit less so than more writing based typos and the previous mentioned problem.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>In the end, I was able to change the text of my page to be more than simply the most basic font and spacing through what we went over
		   in this lesson. Specificaly, I experimented with outlines and weird fonts like wingings to really just have some fun with this text. beyond that
		   this lab went by fairly quickly and I felt like I was more than able to acomplish what I wanted to create.</p>
