			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>This lab is a major continuation of the last one, focusing on floating inline block elements and arranging elements on the right and left
			   alongside working to get images and text to line up in the middle of a webpage with the limitations that that entails in mind. We should be keeping
		     this in mind alongside working to better improve and make use of what we explored in the previous connected lab. There is also an additional challenge
			   within using overlap and a DIV that is smaller than the image its containing, as an optional additional bit of practice.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I feel like I struggled a lot with this lab, and realized that I super dont understand a lot and forgot a lot while trying to get things to look good
				 at the very least, the number of mistakes and just kinda ugly design choices I made makes me wanna spend a lot more time working and studying what
			   weve already gone over. I feel like I have little to know memory or understanding of the difference between block and inline elements, I feel like
			   i straight up forgot about aside and other non-div tags like it and generally I guess I feel like Ive realized I don't have as firm a grasp on css
				 as I thought I did. Also I probably misspelled some stuff and I think I made a few formatting mistakes as well.</p>
			<h2>End Results</h2>
			<p>I managed to get everything done although it did feel like the bare minimum if im honest. I collected all the lab specific stuff and placed it within
				 an aside sidebar which neatly houses all of that plus the links to the css code and the homepage. Aside from that, I also tried out adding in a background
			   image from a game I very much enjoy and I absolutely wouldn't have been able to do it without Polly's help</p>
