	<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>The challenge here is, much like lab 13, focused around recreating a website and making use of layers, overlapping elements, and applying or improving
		   our understanding of how to control where elements are on a page, as well as effectively using the different kinds of elements that form most
		   webpages and html files. its a cumulative review through practice in a way and, considering how lab 13 went for Polly and I, it honestly probably
		   won't go over all that smoothly although it is absolutely reachable.</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>This lab actually ended up going a lot smoother than lab 13, much to our collected excitement! overall I think that, although we did have similar issues
		   as lab 13, we managed to take what we learned from that and, after a break to collect ourselves, find a workflow through it. We encountered issues with
		   getting content boxes to be the correct size as before, but we managed to tackle that by making a temporary border and just experimenting until we found
		   something that worked. Also we were much more leaniant to look things up on w3schools this time around which majorly helped.</p>
	<h2>End Result</h2>
		<p>outside of the font and the background image, I'd say we were able to almost completely duplicate our referenced website, with proper spacing, use of
		    inline elements and general organization. it was super encouraging that we quite literally found the perfect font, that being a variation on Spartan, and I feel
			  a whole lot more confident about working with nonstandard fonts going forwards!</p>
