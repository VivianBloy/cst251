			<p>Hello! my name's Vivian (She/they although I prefer she if possible). I'm a digital artist and creator that is
			currently working on learning more about how computers do the thing. I enjoy creating weird and strange things,
			especially characters and creatures, and I have an undying love for the Virginian Opossum. Above this paragraph
			is a Possum Emoticon free for you to use and spread around however you like. I also play tabletop games like
			MtG and indie computer games such as the much overlooked and incredibly good Rainworld (go play it, its getting
			a fan made and developer supported expansion soon). </p>
