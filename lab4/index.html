		<h1>Lab Contents</h1>
			<div id="Lab Contents">
				<p>This lab covers the general concepts behind the transfer of files between
				local and serverside locations. This includes file uploads, pushing changes,
				and file transfer protocol or "FTP" for short, all of which relate to getting
				file information from your harddrive to the wider internet.</p>
			</div>
		<h2>Summary of Efforts</h2>
			<div id="Summary of Efforts">
				<p>For the most part, my partner and I simply did our due dilligence and formatted
				the required html index files to contain all the correct formatting and Contents, both
				in the form of text and images. We also went over our github and atom applications, tested
				our work within chrome, and in the end, published our individual sites in order to make a
				finished product. The only major issues that showed up during our work involed images and making
				sure the pathways were correctly formatted so that the image could appear when the webpage webpage
				was loaded</p>
			</div>
		<h3>End Results</h3>
			<div id="End Results">
				<p>In the end, we managed to complete all 5 sections of this specific lab smoothly and without
				too much trouble getting things in order. The only major new feeling thing was honestly making
				sure that the end result was fully published but besides that, everything came together.</p>
