		<p>Before you read the following speal, the sidebar on the right contains a number of links where you can look further into human adjacent wildlife and their wellbeing, chiefly of which
			is the monterey wildlife center</p>
		</section>
		<p>When I say the word pest, what comes to mind? maybe bugs like ticks and mosquitoes universally appear in your head, or
			rodentia such as mice and rats. Depending on your background, you might also consider animals like pigeons, seagulls, possums
			spiders, even creatures like wolves and foxes for more forest adjacent or rural areas. While I can absolutely admit that specific of
			these creatures can absolutely cause harm, you won't see me defending the first two listed whatsoever, there is a l o t to
			say about the others and more. There are a deep number of misconceptions that a lot of people have about a lot of beasts, ones
			that I deeply care about, and misconceptions I will try my best to clear through the love I have for oh so many downtrodden creatures.
			Whenever I see, say, a dove sleeping on a sign, a squirrel dashing into its den, a spider rushing across the sidewalk towards some grass,
			or any creature just checking something out before dashing back to safety, I can't help but feel just a little bit appreciative towards them and its all
			because ofâ€¦</p>
		<h2>POSSUMS</h2>
		<p>The gentle (sometimes) Opossum, otherwise known as didelphis virginiana, is my favorite living thing for a good multitude of reasons. Honestly I'm kind of
			obsessed with these funky little creatures and my bias will definitely be affecting how I speak of them, but I still absolutely feel like they inspired me with
			a lot of my current feelings. I have a very clear memory of bringing up possums with a friend and them responding in disgust because their families farm has a
			history of trouble with them sneaking in and harming their chickens. While I absolutely understand the disdain for that reason, it also made me think of how so many
			of these animals that people call pest services to remove are just trying to survive. especially in the case of opossums who are often forced into living into close
			proximity with humans, they're just doing their best to survive outside of their natural habitat, or while being so harshly affected by the lives of humans. same goes
			for everything from raccoons to foxes to even wolves. And admittedly, opossums are incredible at surviving in cities and towns if forced to, although where they really
			thrive, where they show off their true colors as some incredibly important parts of the ecosystem, is in american forests. Opossums often feed on tics and other
			parasitic animals, and not just off themselves. There has been documented evidence of larger creatures like deer and moose stopping by opossums and said gray fluffy
			little forest royalty helping them out with tic issues. Opossums are also surprisingly resistant to rabies due to their natural body heat, preventing the spread of
			the disease and in doing so, helping out their ecosystem as a whole. They're legitimately just helpful creatures, if a little territorial. Also just look at them,
			they're legitimately some of the most adorable creatures I can think of and the day I get to care for an opossum in wildlife rehab will be the day that will make me
			the happiest woman on earth.</p>
		<p>Ok my personal bias aside, even though I could gush about the entire order didelphis aside, I do want to move forwards with the disclaimer that, while I am defending
			a number of "pests'' I in no way am suggesting supporting the livelihood of invasive species. even if it's not their fault that they are here. That aside, a lot of creatures
			fall under the umbrella that often forces possums to enter human living spaces, animals like doves, bats, rats, mice, and spiders all alike in that they absolutely can be
			helpful to their local environment but can also easily be forced into human created spaces. Spiders help keep specific insect populations in check, right alongside animals such
			as rodents and bats. Bats even have one up as they can and often do act as pollinators and help with the dispersal of seeds. Pigeons are a bit of a different story however
			because they are a slightly rare but still sad story of humanity domesticating an animal only to just up and leave them and treat them with disgust. Flat out, pigeons and doves
			are the same species, only differentiating in feather color, and both originating from domestication. And nowadays, they are seen as problems just because we connect them with
			disgusting circumstances. It's much like how we so often see pigs and hogs as disgusting animals because of the environment we put them in. if a wild boar has the opportunity too, and
			Instead of being forced into living conditions with dirty water and mud, they will absolutely do pig-like behavior while keeping themselves clean and cared for. Then there are foxes and
			wolves, both creatures that are often seen as tricky, sly, or even straight up evil because of humanities history with them. In reality, they are fairly non confrontal creatures that will
			stay away from humans unless forced into close quarters, and when they are forced into these situations, they often have to find food wherever they can, most often in the ownership of
			farmers. This specifically has lead to a modern perspective, specifically in wolves, that leaves me deeply saddened. To this very day, there are hunters who lure wolves outside of
			the protected area of yellowstone national park just to kill them, and lawmakers trying to cause whole populations of wolves, wolves who do great things for the balance of their natural
			environment because they are a necessary part of specific ecosystems, just because of so many of the misconceptions that so many people have about them.

		<h3>I ADORE THESE ANIMALS BUT I IN NO WAY SUPPORT THEM BEING KEPT AS PETS OR BEING KEPT BY NON PROFESSIONALS</h3>
		<p>As a side tangent, please don't go out of your way to try to obtain exotic pets. there are people who try to keep animals ranging from foxes to Opossums, even to monkeys as "pets", all of
			which only leads to these animals being in harmful or unhealthy situations from people who don't truly know how to take care of them. If, like me, you enjoy following animal content online
			and enjoy these wonderful beasts as much as I do, absolutely look for rehabilitators and rehabilitation centers that take care of animals that are
			either being pushed towards being let back out into the wild or who for one reason or another, need to stay in care for the rest of their natural lives.
