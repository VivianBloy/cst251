		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>The challenges surrounding this lab mainly focus on making sure that we're correctly formatting how selectors within a CSS file relate to
			   those written within the html file itself. Through this we should be able to get more accurate control of the look and styleization of
			 	 the elements within the webpage as a whole. This also includes working with fonts, spacing, colors, and general formatting.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		 <p>Alongside usual typos that lead to odd issues or glitches there was issues with actually getting any changes to occure and them just
		  	not happeneing for one unclear reason or another, such as a background box not showing up or a font just not agreeing even if it looks
				entirely ok on the code side of things.</p>
