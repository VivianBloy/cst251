		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>As this is the first real lab when we are making a CSS file from scratch, many of the upcoming challenges will
				 almost definitely pertain to correct formatting, Also I imagine the tweeks needed to make sure tags and their corrosponding
			 	 CSS code lines are all sorted and valid to create a final website that actually looks good and works well. ALso keeping all the differnt
			 	 specific CSS tags in line in my head seems like its gonna be something of a challange.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>There were so many small errors I ran into, forgetting a bracket or a colon of some kind
			   forgetting to delete something when fixing some formatting, and generally just struggling with how
				 you're supposed to format CSS as a whole, as it feels a little unituitive, especially with what does and what doesn't work color
			   wise, text wise, and section wise. I honestly think I was only just barely able to get what I wanted to.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>In the end, a page with CSS feels a whole lot better than one without it, even if I didn't really add much outside of where
				 text should go and making sure the image and background were correctly styled to suit what I was trying to get. I think I still
			   Need to do a whole lot of practice in order to get more comfortable with writing up a CSS sheet, and probably refer to a whole
			   lot more guides in the future as well. Thankfully, I think I made a fairly good looking site that doesn't hurt the eyes, at least
			   not fully.</p>
