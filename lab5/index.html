			<h2>Lab Details</h2>
				<p>This lab is mainly about getting more practice in with wrangling HTML and
					inserting specific links and files within pages. This includes placing images, links to other
					html files and files from around the internet, and keeping everything formatted alongside that.
					Mainly we just want to be reinforcing and working with keeping the formatting correct while producing
					products at a steady pace and while adding elements more complicated than just text.</p>
			<h2>Problems Encountered</h2>
				<p>The main issue I encountered while making sure all the boxes were checked was makign sure
					the formatting was entirely to my liking, such as making sure the lunks themselves were fully in
					order and on a seperate line from the images I chose. Aside from that the only minor issues that
					arose just came up with being positive that every I was dotted and ever T was crossed as I went along.</p>
			<h2>End Result</h2>
				<p>In the end, I think I resulted with a successful webpage that met all the requirements and wasn't just a block of text and images.
				I also feel like I understand a bit more about specific tags and what they exactly mean and are doing when I'm using them, such as
				two dots before an adress or the div tag.</p>
