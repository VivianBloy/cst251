		<h1>Lab 3: File Structure</h1>
			<div id="Challenge">
			<p>For this lab and the accociate lesson, the main focus was on properly structured files
			within HTML, keeping things organized in a project, and how to refer or like to different areas
			in a greater HTML file. We used our overall cst251 as an example of file strucutre, exploring concepts
			such as parent and sibling files as well as file naming convensions. With these in mind, me and my
			partner created our individual homepages and constructed a bulleted list within those pages that link
			to different webpages we have already created or are going to create in the near future.</p>
			</div>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
	 		<div id="Problems">
			<p>The main issue we hit when working on our index's came along when trying to incorperate an image at the
			correct size and with linking within the greater html doccument itself. Adress lines were specifically tricky,
			making sure all the syntax and slashes were in their place in order to pull up the correct file or lead to the
			correct index when clicked.</p>
			</div>
		<h3>Final Result</h3>
			<div id="Final Results">
			<p>In the end, we both managed to complete both required indexes and their accodiated webpages. The Image issues we
			were having were hammered out and in the end, we were both left with fairly complete and well structured home webpages
			that linked through our HTML's to the correct files and the correct pages. Alongside the completed pages, I think we also
			bolstered the work we did and the things we explored in the 2nd lab.</p>
