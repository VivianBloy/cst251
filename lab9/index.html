			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge to this lab mostly includes working with and editing how the non-text elements can be edited and customized in
				   depth in order to make a fully personalized site or a site that meets exact designations for its appearence. this includes how
				 	 and where an image appears on the file, the backgrounds, outlines, and margines that make up the overall background of the page
				   and the extent to which each element, both block and inline, relates to each-other within the file.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>The problems for this lab mainly arise when trying to get more complicated looks from the file, such as items that change when a
					 mouse is over it, or how to seperately shift the appearence of one element and not effect other similar ones in an efficient way.
				   Of course, as always, theres simple gramatical mistakes or straight up typoes that can get in the way of the final result. Notibly,
				   also working with my older code from my homepage and editing it to work with a css file was interesting.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>In the end, I feel a lot more confident about my ability to edit how an html file looks through using css, and I feel a whole lot more
				   confident in CSS overall, what with being able to correctly attribute a lot of tags and rules that change how my page looks for the better.
				   I'm admitedly still a little confused as to how text fonts and decorations work, although I don't think ittle be all that hard to understand
				   and put into practice overall. ᘛ⁐̤ᕐᐷ</p>
