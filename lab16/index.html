	<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>This lab is a continuation of the previous one in its mishmash nature of covering different ways to mess and play with css to reach a desired
		   end result and feel of a page. Specifically, messing with the background again and animations seem intimidating although the exact process by which
		   it happens in CSS seems a whole lot easeier than I thought it would be. I'm still absolutely expecting trouble when I'm working on it though, and can
		   see it not working how I want. The other aspects of the general lab seem to be overall handleable too.	</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>Animation ended up being a brease in comparision to transitioning which I am having so much trouble with actually getting to do what its supposed to.
		   The actual time for which the transfer animation should occur is just not working and the element, and image, simply pops from one state to the other when
		   I hover over it. I have no clue how to fix it but aside from that glaring issue, I was able to fix up everything else rather smoothly and make nice little
		   examples of everything.</p>
	<h2>End Result</h2>
		<p>In the end, aside from transitions (which I'm now having a sneaking suspicion might be having problems with trying to change an image), everything went
		   smooth as butter and it all clicked into place. The little animated div works wonders and has a nice little effect, although I am curious as to how to make
		   that animation repeat throughout when the page is loaded, or how to cause it to trigger from something like a hover or a click. I'm near positive some of that
		   was covered in the lecture and I'm now just too tired to remember but aside from all that, It just came out as a nice looking example filled page overall.</p>
