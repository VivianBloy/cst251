		<h3>Challenges</h3>
		<p>The challenge found within this lab mainly focuses on fine tuned layout editing and getting more used to what the properties of "float" and
       "flexbox" to better arange and shift around elements on a webpage. Not only is this good practice getting our heads around each of these ideas,
       it also lets us test out which works best with our own personal design style and how we might combine or work with them in the future as we're creating
       more professional sites.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>It was a straight up struggle to even get my site into working order once I started tinkering with float, things kept getting out of allighnement
       and float was just generally not working the way I wanted or expected it too. Most of my problems managed to be solved through playing with the display
       style that certain elements appeared as. As for Flexbox, being a type of styling that I had not messed with whatsoever before working on this lab, </p>
