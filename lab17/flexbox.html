    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>The challenge found within this lab mainly focuses on fine tuned layout editing and getting more used to what the properties of "float" and
       "flexbox" to better arange and shift around elements on a webpage. Not only is this good practice getting our heads around each of these ideas,
       it also lets us test out which works best with our own personal design style and how we might combine or work with them in the future as we're creating
       more professional sites.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>It was a straight up struggle to even get my site into working order once I started tinkering with float, things kept getting out of allighnement
       and float was just generally not working the way I wanted or expected it too. Most of my problems managed to be solved through playing with the display
       style that certain elements appeared as. As for Flexbox, being a type of styling that I had not messed with whatsoever before working on this lab,
       it ended up being very clunky, just with sorting everything and getting the right identifiers to apply to the right flexbox. That said, I feel like
       the process went much simpler with float, and unlike float, I think it should be a whole lot easier to work with in the future with good page management.</p>

		<h3>End Result</h3>
		<p>Honestly, this lab was just generally frustrating but still doable. While the float portion of this practice absolutely kept tripping me up as I just tried
       over and over to get my sidebar aligned the way i want it, I also managed to have a much easier time getting things into kind of the right places with Flexbox
       I feel like, through brute force more or less, I learned a fair bit about working with flexbox and its honestly made me exicted to continue to toy and mess with it
       to my desiered effect in future projects.</p>
