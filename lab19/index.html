				<h3>Challenges</h3>
				<p>The main thing to tackle in this lab is just breaking the barrier for entry for working with a CSS framework, in this case, Bootstrap. off the bat,
				   there's a lot of new formatting to keep track of as well as using and shifting around how we consider divs and classes to work to be more directly effictive in
				   editing a page without the express inclusion of our own css code. Also, although its more simple to understand, the way that the Bootstrap grid is laid out
				 	 is absolutely something to ajust to.</p>

				<h3>Problems</h3>
				<p>The main issue here is just trying to parse all the new formatting and information, specifically with what goes into which div, how to correctly format the nav bar
				   so that it is the correct color, text color, and formatting, and making sure that the fonts and text styles are all working correctly. Alsothe idea of mixing css
				   with the bootstrap sounsd intimidating, albeit I'm wondering if that is even possible, especially when it comes to the addition to more custom colors.</p>

				<h3>Results</h3>
				<p>Thanks to ample use to w3schools and studying how and what is required to be included for bootstrap to even work on a webpage for the purpose of styling it, This entire project
				   and practice session went by really well. I feel like theres still an entire swath of information and ways of manipulating bootstrap </p>
