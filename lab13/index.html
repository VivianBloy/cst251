	<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>Seeing as this lab and its successor has been hyped up as the hardest and most fun lab of the year, I expect the challenge here to come from
	   	the general oddness and newness of a few of the topics we are practicing, as well as making sure the effective layers of our reproduction websites
	   	are coorectly formatted. I also imagine finding good enough clipart and elements for each reproduction site might be a bit of a challenge, as well
	   	as just generally figuring out font sizes, although seeing as its the both of us colaborating on a site, instead of working next to each other on our
	   	own lab sites, I have a feeling that things will go by at least a little smoothly, even if it takes a while.</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>This lab absolutely lived up to its name and was a real trouble to work through. Getting everything lined up, making only one side of a content
		   bars border a color, or even just centering a content box within a page. Where to specifically apply absolute or relative position and how block
		   and inline elements work with different positioning code. Fonts are also absolutely tripping me up as well as just how to line up elements horizontally
		   and correctly working with float as a rule. I'm just honestly still confused overall and still need to find the time where i can just go over the last few
		   lectures and take notes so i can finally lock this all in.</p>
	<h2>End Result</h2>
		<p>In the end we were able to make a version of the final, reference website, albeit a much simplier and more generic one. Im still proud of both Polly
		   and I were able to get something that looked like the original image whatsoever. I think there was more we probably could have done but even just trying
		   to make what we did felt hard enough, on top of both of our confusions when we were trying to work through the CSS file.</p>
