	<h2>Challenge<h2>
		<p>Seeing as this lab and its successor has been hyped up as the hardest and most fun lab of the year, I expect the challenge here to come from
	   	the general oddness and newness of a few of the topics we are practicing, as well as making sure the effective layers of our reproduction websites
	   	are coorectly formatted. I also imagine finding good enough clipart and elements for each reproduction site might be a bit of a challenge, as well
	   	as just generally figuring out font sizes, although seeing as its the both of us colaborating on a site, instead of working next to each other on our
	   	own lab sites, I have a feeling that things will go by at least a little smoothly, even if it takes a while.</p>
