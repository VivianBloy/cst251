  <h2>Lab Details</h2>
		<p>This lab is mainly about the beginnings of css exploration in relation to html, and the tags and dividers within
				the html language that can be used to refer to css. It acts as an introduction to both interactable forms and the general
				layout of pages, and how CSS and HTML interact and relate to eachother.</p>
	<h2>Problems Encountered</h2>
		<p>the only major issues that arrived came in the form of typos and forgetting a slash or quotation mark which caused the page to mess up.
			 The forums also ended up messing both of us up as a few things weren't the most clear, although actually working through it and through trial
			 and error, things got sorted out</p>
	<h2>End Results</h2>
		<p>in the end, I think I managed to make a complete and honestly nice looking webpage, and it makes me excited to experiment with CSS in the
			 future as we continue to work with this medium and create pages with interesting or interactive layouts.</p>
